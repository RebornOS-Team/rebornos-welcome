2) A new pop-up dialog that displays when the "Utilities" page is visible to tell the user that apps are not pre-installed, but will be installed before launch. The dialog can be hidden for future visits by unchecking a checkbox (which can be re-enabled in the configuration file).

3) Changed permissions of .desktop files from 755 to 644 in the PKGBUILDS of both regular and ISO versions.

==============

Fixed changelog scaling.

Version 0.0.17
==============

Fixed missing top image.

Version 0.0.16
==============

1) Windows are made resizeable: It took time to do this because I had used image overlays for a hacky way to set colored backgrounds. They only worked for fixed sizes. I finally learnt the basics of how to use CSS to decorate Gtk widgets and made them look almost the same as how they had when I used image overlays. This part took me a while to get right, with manual adjustments to widget sizes and layouts until they looked "correct".

2) Scrollbars appear for vertical scrolling: When widgets overflow due to font scaling, vertical scrollbars appear automatically.

3) The color shades have been changed a bit to look better in various different dark and light themes.

4) The container sizes have been adjusted to look good in various different themes.

5) The "About" Window has undergone an overhaul with margins, alignments, background color, and a changelog button!
